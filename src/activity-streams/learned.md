# What we've learned?

In this chapter we've:

* Created a super-simple authentication mechanism so we can give our events some user context
* How we can trigger events with different names on the same channel in order to provide more context to events
* How events simplify our client-side application logic by separating out event handlers

## What next?

We've built real-time notification and now activity streams. Next, it's the 101 or real-time technology where we can take everything we've learned and add a layer of security as we [build authenticated real-time chat](../chat).
